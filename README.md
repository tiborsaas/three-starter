# Three starter

Based on [this setup](https://github.com/wildpeaks/example-threejs-esmodule) I've created my version of a Three.js boilerplate to provide a better Three.js coding experience. 

It also features my Rollup plugin that enables you [to load legacy files](https://github.com/tiborsaas/rollup-plugin-threejs-legacy-import) (non ES6 modules) from the examples folder that comes with Three.js. 

Livereload is enabled too.
